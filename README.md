Python-Ernie is a port of the Ruby-based Ernie server by Tom Preston-Werner.  Python-Ernie is the Python server implementation for the BERT-RPC specification.

See the full BERT-RPC specification at [bert-rpc.org](http://bert-rpc.org).


Installation
------------

To install Python-Ernie, you will also need to install the Python port of BERT serializers and Erlastic.

    $ git clone git://github.com/samuel/python-erlastic.git
    $ cd python-erlastic
    $ sudo python setup.py install
    
    $ git clone git://github.com/samuel/python-bert.git
    $ cd python-bert
    $ sudo python setup.py install

To install python-ernie itself, git clone this repo and run
this from the python-ernie directory:

    $ sudo python setup.py install


Example Handler
---------------

    from ernie import mod, start
    
    def calc_add(a, b):
        return a + b
    mod('calc').fun('add', calc_add)
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        start()


Contribute
----------

If you'd like to hack on Python-Ernie, start by forking my repo on GitHub:

http://github.com/tylerneylon/python-ernie

Just create your own fork, hack on it, and then send me a pull request once done.


Todo
---------

I'll be the first to admin I am still new to Python.  So if I am way off on best practices in Python, let me know!

1. Update exception handling to return traceback
1. Ensure correct handling around read operations
1. See if I can clean up the way you define your modules
1. Test
